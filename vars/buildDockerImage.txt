Build a docker image with the name from microserviceName
Note that the tag is set to the latest commit tag retrieved from Git and currently this version does not support overriding it.

<br>
i.e. does a <code>docker build -t microserviceName:[latest commit tag]</code>

<p style="font-size:14px;"><strong>microserviceName</strong><br><span style="text-indent:40px;display:inline-block;">the name of the project to build a docker image for</span></p>
